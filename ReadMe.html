# QOQ ANALYSIS (SQL) - 40%
This part of the test will include data manipulation exercise.
within the drive folder shared with you you will find 2 relevant files:
site_category_source.csv
site_monthly_visits.csv
Details on the data can be found here:
[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BD5SDHFtxZoaYGthxOfw2COPP9VruWSA?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BD5SDHFtxZoaYGthxOfw2COPP9VruWSA?usp=sharing)

In the instructions document you’ve received step by step details on how to upload the files
to PGadmin so you can query the files using SQL. Make sure you are all set up with the
PGAdmin DB and tables environment before you start. (This is not a necessary step, if you
have a different way to query using SQL that’s fine)

**Tasks:**

*Report - QoQ (Quarter over Quarter Analysis)
Use the tables you’ve created above.
- Top 10 sites per country by QoQ (Quarter over Quarter) positive change of visits.
QoQ positive change of visits means that the site's visits have increased between the last quarter and the current
quarter.
> The script is in the file : QOQ ANALYSIS.sql
> Output table is :

- Expected output schema:
Country, Country_Name, Site, Category, prev_q_visits, next_q_visits, qoq_visits_change
For the Country_Name field you will need to create a country to country name table from this dataset to get country name
and join it with the final output: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)
- Note:
Query optimization is also a factor in this test, try and make the query as ‘elegant’ and light as possible. for example
by avoiding unnecessary JOINs. Make sure you keep websites that do not have any visits data in the final output.

*Visualization
Based on the table you’ve created above - create an interesting graph to present a point about the data, this could be
anything you think that could be interesting about the data, including time based trends, leading categories by country
or most failing sites per month.
You can use any visualization tool you prefer.
